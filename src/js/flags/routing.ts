           return is available).  Disabling this flag means that the Sword of

           to acquire the shell flute (so as not to be stranded).  Continuity
           suggests that actually healing the dolphin should also be required,
           but we've found that this makes the dolphin a lot less useful.  By
           default the fog lamp can be returned before healing the dolphin.  This
