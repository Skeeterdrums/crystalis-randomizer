    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Welcome to Crystalis Randomizer.  This project seeks to
        provide fresh gameplay experiences through the classic NES game
        Crystalis.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <div>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Start with a casual flagset</b>, even if you're super-familiar
        with the original game!  Many of the flags, especially the "hard-mode"
        flags, are simply not suited to beginning players, and will most likely
        lead to frustraton.
      <li>A good way to get started is to turn on some casual flags and to use
        a tracker (such as the one provided here, or else the emotracker pack).
        Clicking on "Track" in the top menu will automatically
        use the currently selected flag set to determine availability of each
        item on the mini map.  Availability is indicated by colors, from red
        (completely blocked) to orange and yellow (available via hard mode
        strat or glitch, respectively) to greenish yellow (available but not
        considered by the current flag's logic) to green (available and probably
        expected).  Locations may be marked as "checked" by clicking on them,
        or by right-clicking on the major item that's usually there.
      <li>Learn the <a href="http://mikesrpgcenter.com/crystalis/index.html#maps">dungeon
        maps</a> to the main key item locations.
      <li>Do not shuffle minor items in with the major ones, and then do not
        worry about the minor item chests.
      <li>Expect to spend 2-4 hours the first time.  With some practice it's
        not too difficult to get down to the 1-2 hour range.
      <li>Grinding is not as time-consuming in the randomizer as in vanilla,
        but levels are a huge help to scale down the difficulty.  Pay attention
        to the EXP from different enemies and grind out a level or two if things
        get too difficult.
      <li><span class="item">Medical herbs</span> (especially buffed) are often
        more valuable than <span class="item">magic rings</span>.
        <span class="item">Warp boots</span> are also very helpful, both for fast
        travel and for getting out of a pinch.  Always keep one or two in inventory.
        They can be stolen from <span class="location">Brynmaer</span>.
      <li>Learn to exploit the most important glitches:
        <ul>
        <li>Shop glitch: get an item for cheap (or free) by selecting a
          neighboring item (or blank space), then press the direction toward
          the item you want and very quickly afterwards (next frame or two)
          tap A to buy it for the previously-selected price.  Take advantage
          of this at the start of the game by walking through the new passage
          to <span class="location">Portoa</span> and stealing some better armor.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j05u6x3irNg&list=PLyA9BtOXggkiOGWAj-tjnqLang97E8G7C&index=7">See video explanation</a>
        <li>Statue glitch: pass a number of spots that are supposed to
          be blocked by statues or guards by approaching them from the right,
          then holding left and down while continually dismissing the dialog.
          You will be pushed up a little each time and eventually will pass
          them.  To do the reverse, hold down and right to be pushed left.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROBcZpUwiJ8&list=PLyA9BtOXggkiOGWAj-tjnqLang97E8G7C&index=5">See video explanation</a>
        <li>Stom fight glitch: warp to <span clas="location">Leaf</span>
          immediately after Stom takes the first stab to win the fight right
          away.  Don't warp anywhere else as it can softlock the game.
        <li>Sword charge glitch: higher level charges can be used temporarily
          without having the ball or bracelet if a different sword does have
          the higher level upgrade.  To do so, equip the sword and the higher
          upgrade and leave the inventory screen.  Then go back into inventory,
          equip the sword without the upgrade, and before leaving the menu,
          press "start" to save the game.  Soft-reset the console and load the
          game.  The higher charges (and higher damage) will be available until
          the inventory screen is entered.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hXOutvuD1Q&index=2&list=PLyA9BtOXggkiOGWAj-tjnqLang97E8G7C">See video explanation</a>
        <li>A few very specific skips are also possible:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsHdN4_5q4M&list=PLyA9BtOXggkiOGWAj-tjnqLang97E8G7C&index=1">Teleport skip</a>,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Ou1TI8yTk&index=4&list=PLyA9BtOXggkiOGWAj-tjnqLang97E8G7C">Rabbit skip</a>,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0SFVii-U-U&index=6&list=PLyA9BtOXggkiOGWAj-tjnqLang97E8G7C">Ghetto flight</a>
        <li>Many of these glitches may be disabled completely.  If the shop
          glitch is disabled, then larger gold drops will be provided.
        </ul>
      <li>The early game is the hardest, when you don't have many sword options.
        Once it starts to open up a bit, things usually get quite a bit easier.
      </ul>

    <h1>Gameplay Changes</h1>
    <div>
      <p>A number of gameplay changes have been made to support randomization.
      <ul>
      <li>Items are shuffled throughout the game.  Items are split into five
        categories (key items (anything required for progression, like swords,
        orbs, bows, and fetch quest items), bonus items (unique items not
        required for progression, like the passive equipped items), consumables
        (non-unique items), magics, and traps (mimics).  Flags are provided to
        control exactly whether and how these categories are shuffled.
      <li>Adds a "difficulty level", which can be seen in the
        bottom-right corner next to the player's level.  Each key or
        bonus item that is picked up increases the difficulty level by 1, to a
        maximum of 47.
      <li>Enemies are shuffled throughout the game.
      <li>Enemy stats (attack, defense, HP, experience and gold
        rewards) are normalized based on the difficulty level.
      <li>A passage is (optionally) opened between <span class="location">Valley
        of Wind</span> and <span class="location">Lime Tree</span>.
      <li>A number of triggers have been slightly changed (see below).
      <li>A number of characters spawn in multiple locations independent of
        game events (e.g. <span class="npc">Zebu</span> remains in <span class="location">Zebu's
        Cave</span> the entire game, rather than "moving" to <span class="location">Shyron</span>
        after calming the sea).
      <li>Some minor bug fixes: screen shaking is fixed, and <span class="boss">Vampire 2</span>
        no longer speeds up near the start of the fight.
      <li><span class="location">Swan gate</span> now has a pair of guards on the opposite side,
        to allow going through either direction (with <span class="magic">Change</span>).
        The guards will only despawn after the gate is open.
      <li>It is now possible to teleport out of the tower, and to get
        back in via the <span class="location">crypt</span>.
      <li><span class="item">Sword of Thunder</span> always teleports to
        <span class="location">Shyron</span>, no matter where it's found
        (though this can be disabled).  The warp checkpoint is immediately set,
        and in case there's no way back, <span class="npc">Asina</span> will
        teleport the player back to <span class="location">Mezame Shrine</span>.
      <li>When continuing, a minimum amount of "pity" HP and MP are given.
        Normally this is 5 HP and 1 MP (to prevent immediate death from
        terrain and ensure <span class="magic">Flight</span> is possible), but
        when swordless it is 20 MP (to ensure <span class="magic">Change</span>
        or <span class="magic">Teleport</span> is possible as well).
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Items</h1>
    <div>
      <ul>
      <li>Inventory sorting is disabled for swords and orbs/bracelets to prevent
        items from clobbering each other.
      <li>Key items can overflow into an invisible buffer; if you have items in
        this buffer, you can "drop" a key item to recover the overflowed items.
        The "dropped" item will take its place in the buffer.
      <li><span class="item">Alarm Flute</span> is now a key item, given by
        Zebu's student (along with the starting cash) in Leaf.
      <li><span class="item">Alarm Flute</span> and <span class="item">Flute of
        Lime</span> are now multi-use items. Each will disappear after the
        second successful use.
      <li>The second <span class="item">Flute of Lime</span> chest now contains
        a <span class="item">Mirrored Shield</span> and is counted as a bonus
        item for shuffling purposes.
      <li>Orbs and bracelets are progressive upgrades: the first item you get,
        even if it says "bracelet" will give you the orb, and the second will
        give the bracelet.  The distinction is important only because
        <span class="npc">Tornel</span> on <span class="location">Mt Sabre</span>
        is keyed off finding the <emph>chest<emph> that gives the <span class="item">Tornado
        Bracelet</span>, rather than by finding both upgrades.
      <li>Orbs and bracelets may now (optionally) be automatically equipped.
        Just change swords and the powerup will change, too.
      <li>Sword damage has been renormalized.  Rather than depending on the
        element (normally, wind=1, fire=2, water=4, thunder=8), the sword power
        depends on the number of upgrades (no upgrades=2, ball only=4, bracelet=8).
      <li>Stab damage no longer doubles the sword base power, but is
        now always just 2, on top of the base power of the sword.
      <li>The <span class="item">Power Ring</span> is nerfed to double the
        sword base damage, rather than the level.
      <li><span class="item">Pendant of Deo</span> is buffed to provide MP while
        moving (under <span class="flag">Td</span>).
      <li><span class="item">Iron Necklace</span> and <span class="item">Shield
        Ring</span> are buffed to double the armor/shield value, rather than the
        level.
      <li><span class="item">Rabbit Boots</span> now also allows charging swords
        to level 2 while moving (under <span class="flag">Tr</span>).
      <li><span class="item">Leather Boots</span> are (optionally) replaced with
        <span class="item">Speed Boots</span>.
      <li><span class="item">Medical Herb</span> and <span class="item">Fruit of
        Power</span> can be optionally buffed to three different levels: in
        hard mode (<span class="flag">Hm</span>) there is no buff (32 HP, 32 MP),
        in default mode (no flag) they are buffed to 64 HP and 48 MP.  In easy
        mode (<span class="flag">Em</span>) they are buffed to 96 HP and 64 MP.
      <li>Mimics will only ever shuffle into visible chests (this does not include
        boss drops).
      <li>Consumables and armor/shields can only shuffle into chests, so that
        a full inventory does not cause the item to disappear.
      <li><span class="item">Opel Statue</span> now works automatically and
        cannot be selected.  It also correctly clears status effects.
      <li><span class="item">Psycho Shield</span> and <span class="item">Psycho
        Armor</span> are nerfed to only provide 20 DEF each.
        <span class="item">Battle Shield</span> and <span class="item">Ceramic
        Armor</span> are now the armors with highest (32) DEF.
      <li><span class="item">Sacred Shield</span> now prevents curse instead of
        paralysis.  <span class="item">Ceramic Shield</span> blocks paralysis.
      <li><span class="item">Platinum Shield</span> and <span class="item">Mirrored
        Shield</span> each have 2 DEF extra.
      <li>Powerful armors will only provide up to a maximum of LVL*3 defense.
      <li>Shops are now randomized (under <span class="flag">Ps</span>).
        The prices of tools and inns increases over time (doubling every 10
        scaling levels), while the prices of armors decreases over time (halving
        every 12 scaling levels).
      <li>Flute of Lime can be used twice for both the "guards" as well as Akahana.
      <li>Alarm Flute can no longer be found in shops but is instead shuffled in as 
        a multi-use key item for windmill guard and Kensu.
      </ul>

    <h1>Triggers</h1>
    <div>
      <p>In the following, items in brackets refer to whatever item
        is shuffled into a slot, while unparenthesized items refer to the
        actual item.
      <ul>
      <li>Zebu, Tornel, Stom, Akahana, Asina, and Kensu are always available
        in the different locations as long as they need to be, regardless of
        any other story events that occur.
      <li>Zebu will spawn the sleeping Windmill Guard even after starting the
        windmill.
      <li>Tornel teaching [Teleport] is blocked on finding exactly the
        Tornado Bracelet, regardless of whether the Ball of Wind has been
        found.
      <li>[Barrier] now (optionally) requires calming the sea, rather
        than just ghetto flight.
      <li>The Queen of Portoa will not "go on vacation" and reveal herself as
        Asina until after the Mesia recording has been viewed (this ensures
        both Sword and Orb of Water are acquired, guaranteeing that the back
        room is reachable).
      <li>If Queen of Portoa doesn't give [Flute of Lime] before turning into
        Asina, just talk to her again after getting [Recover].
      <li>Fog Lamp cannot be returned unless Shell Flute is
        acquired. Optionally (with the 'Rd' flag), it's also required
        to have healed the dolphin (note that this means that without
        the flag it's possible to heal the dolphin while riding the
        dolphin.  Don't worry, it's his sister).
      <li>Kensu will not appear in the beach cabin until Fog Lamp has been
        returned.
      <li>The Shyron massacre requires both the actual Sword of Thunder and
        getting the [Key to Stxy] from Zebu in Shyron.
      </ul>

    <h1>Bug Reports</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Please report bugs either on
      <a href="https://github.com/shicks/crystalis-randomizer/issues">GitHub</a>
      or on the Discord.  An effective bug report includes the following:
      <ul>
        <li>All relevant information about the seed: the software
          version that generated it, the flag set, the seed, and the
          checksum.  These can all be seen in the "codename entry"
          computer upon starting a new game, but the easiest way to
          get it is The easiest way to get this is to <a href="check">
          extract it directly from the image</a>.
        <li>As much detail as possible to reproduce the bug.  A link
          to a twitch clip of the bug manifesting is ideal, together
          with explanation of any preceding events that seem relevant.
          At the very least, answer the following questions: (1) what
          were you doing, (2) what did you expect to happen, and (3)
          what happened instead?
